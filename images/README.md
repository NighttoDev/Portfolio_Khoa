## Image Optimization Tips

- Compress images before uploading using:
  - [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
  - [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)
  - [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) (Mac)

- Keep file sizes under 200KB for best performance

## Temporary Placeholder

Until you add your images, you can use placeholder services:

- https://via.placeholder.com/400x400
- https://picsum.photos/400/400
- https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=Khoa+Tran&size=400

To use a placeholder, update the image src in `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Example with placeholder -->
<img src="https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=Khoa+Tran&size=400" alt="Khoa Tran">
```
